    """Base Class for defining the concept of an "Intent" within Foreshadow.

    Provides the base infrastructure for the fundamental functionality of an intent.
    An intent is a singleton class that serves as the fundamental logical component
    of Foreshadow and exists as part of a ordered tree hierarchy.

    Intents contain a single pipeline and a multi pipeline attribute. These
    attributes determine the operations that are applied to features to which that
    intent is assigned. Single pipelines are individually applied to single columns
    and multi pipelines are applied across all columns of a given intent.

    When a column is encountered in a data frame, all intents loaded into the
    Foreshadow system are iterated in a top-down fashion from least-specific intent
    to most-specific intent until an intent is found for which no more specific
    intents match.

    To support this process each Intent contains a is_intent classmethod which is
    independently executed to determine whether a specific intent (and its pipelines)
    should be applied to a feature. The most specific intent for which is_intent
    returns true is the intent that is assigned to that feature.

    Attributes:
        single_pipeline: Pipeline that is executed on a single column. Can create
            multiple columns.
        multi_pipeline: Pipeline that is executed across all columns of the given
            intent. Can reduce or create more columns.
